# Mini Egg Cups (Ham, Cheese & Spinach)

Perfect for shallow silicone molds and meal prep!

## Ingredients

- 8 large eggs
- 1/4 cup heavy cream (or milk)
- 1 cup diced ham
- 1 cup fresh spinach, chopped (or 1/2 cup frozen, thawed and squeezed dry)
- 1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Swiss, or mozzarella)
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Cooking spray or butter (for greasing)

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven:** Set to 350°F.

2. **Prep trays:** Lightly spray or butter your silicone molds. Place on a baking sheet for stability.

3. **Whisk eggs:** In a large bowl, whisk eggs with heavy cream, garlic powder, salt, and pepper until well combined.

4. **Add fillings:** Stir in diced ham, chopped spinach, and 3/4 cup of the cheese (save 1/4 cup for topping).

5. **Fill molds:** Pour egg mixture into silicone molds, filling about 3/4 full (they'll puff up slightly). Since molds are shallow, don't overfill.

6. **Top with cheese:** Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of each cup.

7. **Bake:** Bake for 15-18 minutes for shallow molds, until eggs are set and tops are lightly golden. Check at 15 minutes.

8. **Cool and remove:** Let cool in molds for 2-3 minutes, then pop out. They should release easily from silicone.

## Tips for Shallow Molds

- **Don't overfill** - eggs will puff up, fill only 3/4 full
- **Watch baking time** - shallow molds cook faster, check at 15 minutes
- **Use baking sheet** - makes it easier to move trays in/out of oven
- **Cool before removing** - eggs will firm up and release easier

## Variations

- **Italian:** Replace ham with cooked sausage, use mozzarella, add Italian seasoning
- **Western:** Add diced bell peppers and onions with the ham
- **Veggie:** Skip ham, add mushrooms, tomatoes, and peppers
- **Bacon & Cheddar:** Use crumbled bacon instead of ham
- **Mexican:** Add salsa, jalapeños, and use pepper jack cheese

## Storage & Reheating

- **Refrigerate:** Store in airtight container for up to 5 days
- **Freeze:** Freeze individually wrapped for up to 2 months
- **Reheat:** Microwave 30-45 seconds or until heated through
- **On-the-go:** Eat cold or room temperature
