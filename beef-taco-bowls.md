- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1/4 tsp oregano
- 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes

### Bowl Base & Toppings

## Instructions

1. **Cook the beef:** Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add lean ground beef and cook, breaking it up, until browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes.

5. **Assemble bowls:** Divide lettuce among serving bowls. Top with seasoned ground beef and vegetable mixture.
