# Mom's Meatloaf

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 lb ground turkey
- 1 cup shredded carrots, cooked and cooled
- 1/2 cup small diced green bell pepper, cooked and cooled
- 1/2 cup small diced onion, cooked and cooled
- 1 1/2 cups Cheez-Its crackers, crushed (instead of breadcrumbs)
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1-2 large eggs (use 2 if mixture seems dry)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.

2. **Prep vegetables:** Cook shredded carrots, diced bell pepper, and diced onion in a skillet with a little oil until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Let cool completely.

3. **Crush crackers:** Place Cheez-Its in a food processor or crush in a sealed bag with a rolling pin until they're fine crumbs.

4. In a large bowl, combine ground beef and ground turkey.

5. Add cooled cooked vegetables, crushed Cheez-Its, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder.

6. Start with 1 egg and mix gently. If mixture seems too dry or won't hold together, add the second egg.

7. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

8. Mix everything together with your hands until just combined - don't overmix.

9. Shape into a loaf and place in a greased 9x5 loaf pan or shape on a baking sheet.

10. Bake 60-70 minutes until internal temperature reaches 160°F.

11. Let rest 10 minutes before slicing.

## Optional Glaze & Toppings

### Glaze Options
**Classic Glaze:**
- 1/4 cup ketchup
- 2 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
Mix together and brush on top during last 15 minutes of baking.

**Simple Options:**
- Just ketchup - brush on during last 15 minutes
- Just BBQ sauce - brush on during last 15 minutes

### Bacon Topping (Optional)
- 4-5 strips raw bacon, laid across the top of the meatloaf before baking
- The bacon will cook and crisp up while the meatloaf bakes
- **Note:** Drain accumulated bacon fat halfway through cooking if needed (around 30-35 minutes)

## Cooking Tips

- Make sure vegetables are completely cooled before adding to meat
- Don't overmix - it makes the meatloaf dense
- Use a meat thermometer for best results
- The Cheez-Its add great flavor and help bind the loaf
- Let it rest before slicing or it will fall apart
