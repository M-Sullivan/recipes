# Simple Crepes

## Ingredients

- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/4 cups milk
- 2 tbsp melted butter
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- Butter for cooking

## Fruit Options
- Fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries)
- Sliced bananas
- Diced apples with cinnamon
- Fresh peach slices
- Mixed berry compote

## Instructions

1. In a blender or large bowl, combine flour, eggs, milk, melted butter, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Blend or whisk until smooth.

2. Let batter rest for 30 minutes (this helps make tender crepes).

3. Heat a non-stick pan or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly butter the pan.

4. Pour about 1/4 cup batter into center of pan, quickly tilting and rotating to spread batter evenly across bottom.

5. Cook 1-2 minutes until edges are lightly golden and crepe easily lifts from pan.

6. Flip and cook 30 seconds more on other side.

7. Transfer to plate and repeat with remaining batter.
