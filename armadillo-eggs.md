# Armadillo Eggs (Florida-Style Scotch Eggs)

## Ingredients

- 6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled
- 1 lb ground pork sausage (breakfast sausage works great)
- 1 cup all-purpose flour (or almond flour for low-carb)
- 2 raw eggs, beaten
- 2 cups panko breadcrumbs (or crushed pork rinds for low-carb)
- Oil for frying (or cooking spray for baking)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Optional: 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper for heat

## Instructions

1. **Prepare eggs:** Hard-boil 6 eggs, cool in ice water, and peel carefully.

2. **Wrap eggs:** Divide sausage into 6 portions. With wet hands, flatten each portion and wrap around a hard-boiled egg, sealing completely.

3. **Set up breading station:** 
   - Bowl 1: Flour (or almond flour) seasoned with salt and pepper
   - Bowl 2: Beaten raw eggs
   - Bowl 3: Panko breadcrumbs (or crushed pork rinds)

4. **Bread the eggs:** Roll each sausage-wrapped egg in flour, then beaten egg, then breadcrumbs. Press gently to help coating stick.

5. **Cook (choose method):**

   **Frying:** Heat oil to 350°F. Fry 3-4 minutes until golden brown and sausage is cooked through (internal temp 160°F).

   **Baking:** Preheat oven to 400°F. Place on greased baking sheet, spray with cooking oil. Bake 25-30 minutes, turning once halfway through.

6. **Rest:** Let cool 2-3 minutes before serving.

## Low-Carb Alternatives

**Instead of regular flour:**
- Almond flour (1:1 substitution)
- Coconut flour (use 1/3 the amount)
- Finely grated Parmesan cheese
- Unflavored protein powder

**Instead of panko breadcrumbs:**
- Crushed pork rinds (best option - amazing crunch!)
- Crushed cheese crisps
- Almond flour mixed with Parmesan
- Crushed nuts (pecans, almonds, macadamias)
- Unsweetened coconut flakes

**Note:** Pork rinds give the best texture and are practically zero carbs. Process stays exactly the same!
