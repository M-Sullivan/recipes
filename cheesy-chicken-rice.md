# Cheesy Chicken and Rice

## Ingredients

- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc work well)
- 3 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese (or see alternatives below)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tbsp butter
- Fresh parsley for garnish
- 2 cups fresh or frozen broccoli florets (optional)

## Cheese Alternatives
- Monterey Jack (great melting cheese)
- Colby Jack (mild and creamy)
- Swiss (nutty flavor)
- Pepper Jack (for a kick)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

2. Season chicken pieces with salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, garlic powder, and onion powder.

3. Heat olive oil in a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven. Brown chicken pieces on all sides, about 5-6 minutes. Remove and set aside.

4. In same pan, add diced onion and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook 1 more minute.

5. Add rice and stir for 2 minutes to lightly toast.

6. Pour in white wine and scrape up any browned bits. Let wine reduce by half, about 2 minutes.

7. Add chicken broth and bring to a boil. Return chicken to pan.

8. Cover tightly and bake 25-30 minutes until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed.

9. **Optional:** If using broccoli, stir it in during the last 10 minutes of baking time.

10. Remove from oven and stir in butter and cheese until melted.

11. Let rest 5 minutes, then garnish with fresh parsley.

## Cooking Tips

- Don't skip browning the chicken - it adds lots of flavor
- Use a cheap but drinkable white wine - if you wouldn't drink it, don't cook with it
- Stir in cheese off the heat to prevent it from getting stringy
- Add extra broth if rice looks dry during cooking
