# Chicken Salad Lettuce Wraps

## Ingredients

- 3 cups cooked chicken, diced (rotisserie chicken works great)
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise (full-fat for best flavor)
- 2 celery stalks, finely diced
- 2 tbsp fresh chives, chopped
- 1 tbsp yellow mustard
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1/4 cup toasted pecans or walnuts, chopped (optional)
- 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped (optional but adds richness)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 head butter lettuce or 2 heads Boston lettuce (for wrapping)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare chicken:** If using rotisserie chicken, remove skin and shred or dice the meat. Let cool completely.

2. **Make the salad:** In a large bowl, combine diced chicken, mayonnaise, celery, chives, yellow mustard, and lemon juice.

3. **Add extras:** Fold in chopped nuts and hard-boiled eggs if using.

4. **Season:** Add salt and pepper to taste. Start with 1/2 tsp salt and adjust.

5. **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to let flavors meld.

6. **Prepare lettuce:** Carefully separate lettuce leaves, wash gently, and pat dry.

7. **Assemble:** Place 2-3 spoonfuls of chicken salad in center of each lettuce leaf and wrap like a taco.

## Low-Carb Flavor Boosters

- **Fresh herbs:** Add dill, parsley, or tarragon
- **Crunch factor:** Water chestnuts, diced cucumber, or bell pepper
- **Richness:** Avocado chunks (add just before serving)
