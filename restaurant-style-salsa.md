# Restaurant-Style Salsa

## Ingredients

- 1 can (28 oz) whole peeled tomatoes, drained
- 2-3 jalapeño peppers, seeded and roughly chopped
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves
- 2 tbsp lime juice
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions

1. **Drain tomatoes:** Pour canned tomatoes into a strainer and let drain for 10 minutes.

2. **Blend ingredients:** In a food processor or blender, pulse jalapeños, garlic, and cilantro until finely chopped.

3. **Add tomatoes:** Add drained tomatoes and pulse 8-10 times until chunky (don't over-blend - you want texture).

4. **Season:** Add lime juice, salt, cumin, and black pepper. Pulse 2-3 times to mix.

5. **Rest:** Let salsa sit 30 minutes for flavors to meld. Taste and adjust seasoning.

6. **Store:** Keeps 5-7 days in refrigerator.

## Tips

- Use whole canned tomatoes for best texture - they hold up better than diced
- Adjust jalapeños to taste (start with less, add more for heat)
- Fresh lime juice makes a big difference over bottled
- The salsa gets better after sitting overnight
- Perfect for chips, tacos, burritos, or any Mexican-style dish
