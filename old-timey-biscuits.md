# Old-Timey Biscuits

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 6 tbsp cold butter (or lard for extra traditional)
- 3/4 cup cold buttermilk
- Extra flour for dusting

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425Â°F.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

3. Cut cold butter into small cubes and add to flour mixture.

4. Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work butter into flour until mixture looks like coarse crumbs with some pea-sized butter pieces.

5. Make a well in center and pour in cold buttermilk.

6. Gently stir with a fork just until dough comes together - don't overmix!

7. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface and gently pat (don't roll) to about 3/4 inch thick.

8. Cut straight down with a sharp biscuit cutter or glass - don't twist! Place on ungreased baking sheet with sides touching.

9. Bake 15-17 minutes until tops are golden brown.

10. Brush tops with melted butter while still warm.

## Old-Timey Tips

- Keep everything cold - cold butter, cold buttermilk
- Don't overwork the dough - tough biscuits come from too much handling
- Cut straight down, don't twist the cutter - it seals the edges and prevents rising
- Place biscuits touching each other - they'll rise higher and stay soft on the sides
- For extra flavor, use lard instead of butter (like grandma did!)
- Save the buttermilk - real buttermilk makes the best biscuits

## Detailed Tips & Techniques

### The Butter/Fat Method
- **Cold is key:** Keep butter in fridge until ready to use. Some folks even freeze it for 10 minutes first.
- **Size matters:** Aim for pieces ranging from fine crumbs to pea-sized chunks. Those bigger pieces create flaky layers.
- **Traditional option:** Lard makes incredibly tender biscuits - use the same amount as butter.
- **Work fast:** The heat from your hands can melt the fat, so work quickly.

### The Buttermilk Secret
- **Real vs. cultured:** Traditional buttermilk (leftover from churning) is thinner than store-bought cultured buttermilk.
- **Temperature:** Should be cold from the fridge - warmth activates the baking powder too early.
- **Substitution:** If no buttermilk, add 1 tbsp lemon juice or vinegar to regular milk and let sit 5 minutes.

### Mixing & Handling
- **Less is more:** Stir just until ingredients are barely combined - lumpy is okay!
- **Folding technique:** Some old-timers fold the dough over itself 2-3 times for extra layers.
- **No rolling pin:** Pat by hand to preserve the butter pieces that create flakiness.

### Cutting & Baking
- **Sharp cutter:** Dull edges compress the dough and prevent proper rising.
- **Straight down:** Any twisting motion seals the edges.
- **Snug placement:** Biscuits should just touch - they support each other while rising.
- **Hot oven:** High heat creates steam quickly for maximum lift.

### Troubleshooting
- **Flat biscuits:** Usually from old baking powder, warm ingredients, or overworking.
- **Tough biscuits:** Too much mixing or kneading.
- **Dense biscuits:** Not enough baking powder or expired leavening.
