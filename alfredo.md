# Alfredo Pasta

## Ingredients

- 1 lb fettuccine pasta
- Milk - as needed (maybe 1 1/2 ~ 2 cups?)
- Mozzarella Cheese - 2 or more cups
- Parmesan Cheese - 1-2 cups
- Nutmeg - pinch
- Garlic - to taste
- Butter - 4 tbsp
- Flour - 4 tbsp
- Salt - to taste
- Pepper - to taste
- Parsley - optional, (1 fist full)
- Noodles - 1 box, I prefer linguine, but use whatever

## Instructions

1. Melt the butter in a sauce pan and stir in flour (make a roux).

2. Slowly add milk stirring constantly. It may start to clump, keep adding more until smooth but thick. It will keep thickening and if it does, add a little more milk.

3. Once it looks smooth and sticks to the back of a spoon, start adding in the cheeses a little at a time until melted.

4. Now add the garlic, nutmeg and salt and pepper to taste. Add the salt in a little at a time, tasting as you go.

5. Boil the noodles per package directions (DO NOT OVERBOIL!!!). 

6. Garnish with parsley if you want to make it look pretty.

## Cooking Tips

- Use freshly grated Parmesan for the best flavor
- Don't let the sauce boil, as it may curdle
- Serve immediately while hot
- Add grilled chicken or shrimp for protein
- Use fresh garlic for better flavor and aroma, though garlic powder is also fine
- Cook the roux for 2-3 minutes to get rid of raw flour taste
- Warm the milk slightly before adding to prevent lumps
- Remove pan from heat when adding cheese to prevent it from getting stringy
- Save some pasta water before draining - helps thin sauce if needed
