# Almond Flour Pancakes (Crispy-Edge Style)

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups almond flour (finely ground)
- 4 large eggs
- 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk (or regular milk)
- 2 tbsp cream cheese, softened (helps with binding and texture)
- 2 tbsp sugar (or sugar substitute like erythritol)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp salt
- Butter or oil for cooking

## Instructions

1. **Mix wet ingredients:** In a medium bowl, whisk eggs until well beaten. Add almond milk, softened cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth.

2. **Combine dry ingredients:** In another bowl, whisk together almond flour, baking powder, and salt.

3. **Make batter:** Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Let batter rest 5 minutes (almond flour needs time to absorb liquid).

4. **Heat pan:** Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Add butter or oil.

5. **Cook pancakes:** Pour 1/4 cup batter per pancake. Cook 2-3 minutes until edges look set and slightly crispy. Flip and cook 1-2 minutes more.

6. **Serve:** Serve immediately while edges are still crispy.

## Tips for Perfect Texture

- **Don't overmix** - this keeps them from getting too dense
- **Medium heat** - allows edges to crisp while center cooks through
- **Thin them out** - spread batter slightly with back of spoon for thinner, crispier pancakes
- **Rest the batter** - gives almond flour time to hydrate properly
- **Use butter in pan** - helps create those crispy edges you want

## Serving Suggestions

- Sugar-free syrup for low-carb
- Fresh berries
- Whipped cream
- Butter and cinnamon
- Nut butter drizzle

## Recipe Variations

- **Extra crispy:** Add 1 tbsp melted butter to batter
- **Vanilla boost:** Use 1 tsp vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp
- **Slightly sweet:** Increase sugar to 3 tbsp
- **Savory option:** Omit sugar, add herbs and cheese

## Storage Tips

- Best served fresh for crispy edges
- Leftover pancakes can be reheated in toaster for crispness
- Batter keeps 1 day in fridge (may need to thin with more milk)
