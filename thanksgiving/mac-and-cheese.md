# Mac and Cheese

## Ingredients

- 1 box (1 lb) elbow macaroni noodles
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 2.5-3 cups whole milk (or 2% milk)
- 3-4 cups shredded cheese (cheddar or a mix of varieties like sharp cheddar, gruyere, fontina, or monterey jack)
- Salt - to taste (plus extra for pasta water)
- Pepper - to taste

## Instructions

1. Salt a large pot of water and bring to a boil. While the water is heating, begin preparing the cheese sauce.

2. In a sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat and stir in flour to make a roux.

3. Cook the roux until it reaches a blonde color (doesn't take long - just a couple minutes).

4. Once water is boiling, add the elbow macaroni and cook to just under al dente according to box instructions. Before draining, save about 1/2 cup of pasta water. Drain noodles and set aside.

5. While pasta is cooking, start adding milk to the roux, beginning with about 1 cup while stirring constantly.

6. Continue stirring and adding remaining milk gradually (another 1.5-2 cups) as the roux becomes incorporated and the mixture starts to thin. Cook and whisk over medium heat until the sauce gently simmers and thickens to the consistency of heavy cream, about 5 minutes.

7. Once the sauce is smooth and thickened, reduce heat to low and start adding cheese a handful at a time, allowing each addition to melt completely before adding more.

8. Continue adding cheese until you achieve the right consistency and color. The sauce should stick to the back of a spoon and coat it thickly. If the sauce becomes too thick, use the reserved pasta water or a splash of additional milk to thin it.

9. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

10. Stir the cooked noodles and cheese sauce together until well combined.

## Cooking Tips

- Use a block of cheese and shred it yourself - MUCH better than pre-shredded (pre-shredded cheese contains anti-caking agents that can affect melting and create a grainy texture)
- Let cheese come to room temperature before adding - it melts more smoothly
- A mix of different cheeses gives better flavor than cheddar alone - try combining sharp cheddar for flavor, gruyere for creaminess, and fontina for smoothness
- The 3-4 cups of cheese is an eyeball measurement - check the color and consistency as you go
- Don't overcook the noodles - slightly undercooked is better as they'll continue to soften in the sauce
- Keep extra milk nearby to adjust consistency if needed
- Reduce heat to low when adding cheese to prevent it from getting stringy or separating
- Reserved pasta water is starchy and helps the sauce cling to the noodles better than plain milk
