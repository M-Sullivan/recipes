Now that you understand your situation and have chosen your meal planning style, let's walk through the actual process of planning and prepping meals. This is the practical, actionable guide to getting it done.

## Overview: The 5-Step Process

1. **Take Inventory** - Know what you have
2. **Plan Your Menu** - Decide what to eat
3. **Create Your Grocery List** - Know what to buy
4. **Smart Shopping** - Get the ingredients efficiently
5. **Meal Prep Execution** - Prepare the food

Let's break down each step in detail.

---

## Step 1: Take Inventory

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes  
**When to Do It:** Before planning your menu (same day is fine)

The biggest mistake people make is planning meals without checking what they already have. This leads to buying duplicates, forgetting about ingredients that spoil, and wasted money.

### The Three-Zone Check

#### Zone 1: Pantry
**Quick Scan (5 minutes):**
- What grains do you have? (Rice, pasta, quinoa, etc.)
- What canned goods? (Beans, tomatoes, coconut milk, etc.)
- What proteins? (Canned tuna, chicken, etc.)
- What condiments and sauces?
- What baking supplies?

**Write Down:**
- Items you have plenty of (use these in this week's plan!)
- Items running low (add to shopping list)
- Items close to expiration (prioritize in meal planning)

**Pro Tip:** Keep a running pantry inventory list on your phone or fridge. Update it as you use things up. This makes the weekly check much faster.

#### Zone 2: Refrigerator
**Quick Scan (5 minutes):**
- What proteins need to be used? (Check dates!)
- What vegetables are getting soft or wilted?
- What dairy is about to expire?
- What leftovers exist?
- What partial ingredients are waiting? (Half an onion, opened can of something, etc.)

**Prioritize:**
1. **Use This Week (1-3 days):** Meat near expiration, wilting vegetables, leftovers
2. **Use This Week (3-5 days):** Fresh vegetables, fresh proteins
3. **Can Wait:** Recently purchased items, items with long shelf life

**The "Must Use" List:**
Create a sticky note or section on your planning sheet:
- Chicken breasts (expires Oct 28)
- Half a bell pepper
- Spinach starting to wilt
- 2 cups leftover rice

**Plan at least 2 meals around these items!**

#### Zone 3: Freezer
**Quick Scan (5 minutes):**
- What frozen proteins? (Date them if not dated!)
- What frozen vegetables?
- What pre-made freezer meals?
- What items have been there too long? (Over 3-6 months)

**Strategic Planning:**
- Plan to use 1-2 freezer items per week (rotate your stock)
- Note what needs to be used soon
- Assess space for new meal prep

**Pro Tip:** Take a freezer inventory photo on your phone. Update it monthly. No more "mystery meat" situations!

### Inventory Worksheet Example

```
MUST USE THIS WEEK:
- Chicken breasts (exp 10/28) - 1.5 lbs
- Bell peppers (getting soft) - 2
- Spinach (wilting) - 1 bunch
- Leftover rice - 2 cups

HAVE ON HAND:
- Pasta - 2 boxes
- Canned black beans - 4 cans
- Coconut milk - 2 cans
- Frozen broccoli - 2 bags
- Ground beef in freezer - 2 lbs

RUNNING LOW (add to shopping list):
- Olive oil
- Garlic
- Onions
- Eggs
```

---

## Step 2: Plan Your Menu

**Time Required:** 20-45 minutes (gets faster with practice)  
**When to Do It:** 1-2 days before shopping day

This is where the magic happens! You're going to decide what you'll eat for the week.

### Before You Start Planning

**Gather Your Tools:**
- Calendar (to check your schedule)
- Recipe sources (cookbooks, websites, apps, or your personal collection)
- Inventory list from Step 1
- Blank meal planning template (paper, digital, or just a notebook)

**Check Your Schedule:**
Review the week ahead:
- Which days are busy? (Need quick meals)
- Which days have more time? (Can cook more elaborate meals)
- Any special events? (Dinners out, guests, potlucks)
- What days will you meal prep?

### The Planning Process

#### A. Decide How Many Meals to Plan

**Beginners:** Start with 3-4 dinners  
**Intermediate:** Plan 5-6 dinners  
**Advanced:** Plan all meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks)

**Account for:**
- Meals eating out
- Leftover nights
- "Fend for yourself" nights
- Pizza/takeout nights (it's okay to plan for these!)

**Example Week:**
- Monday: Home-cooked dinner
- Tuesday: Home-cooked dinner
- Wednesday: Leftovers from Monday/Tuesday
- Thursday: Home-cooked dinner
- Friday: Pizza night (planned break!)
- Saturday: Dining out
- Sunday: Home-cooked dinner

**Planning requirement:** 4 dinner recipes needed

#### B. Choose Your Recipes

**Strategy 1: The Balanced Week Approach**

Plan for variety in:

**Proteins:**
- 1-2 chicken meals
- 1 beef or pork meal
- 1 fish or seafood meal
- 1 vegetarian meal

**Cooking Methods:**
- 1 slow cooker/instant pot meal (for busy day)
- 1-2 sheet pan/one-pot meals (easy cleanup)
- 1-2 stovetop meals (stir-fry, pasta, etc.)
- 1 baked/roasted meal

**Cuisines:**
- 1 Italian (pasta, etc.)
- 1 Mexican (tacos, etc.)
- 1 Asian-inspired (stir-fry, etc.)
- 1 American comfort food
- 1 Mediterranean

**Effort Level:**
- 2 "easy" meals (20-30 minutes)
- 2 "moderate" meals (30-45 minutes)
- 1 "involved" meal (45-60 minutes, for a day you have time)

**Strategy 2: The Theme Night Approach**

Assign themes to simplify decisions:
- **Monday:** Meatless Monday (vegetarian)
- **Tuesday:** Taco Tuesday (any Mexican food)
- **Wednesday:** One-Pot Wednesday (minimal dishes)
- **Thursday:** Throwback Thursday (comfort food)
- **Friday:** Fresh Fish Friday or Fend-for-Yourself Friday
- **Saturday:** Slow Cooker Saturday or Social Saturday (dining out)
- **Sunday:** Sunday Dinner (family meal)

**Strategy 3: The "Use What You Have" Approach**

Build meals around your inventory:

**Example:**
- **Must use:** Chicken breasts, bell peppers, spinach, leftover rice
- **Have on hand:** Pasta, black beans, coconut milk

**Meals Created:**
1. **Chicken stir-fry:** Chicken + bell peppers + leftover rice (+ buy: soy sauce, ginger, other veggies)
2. **Spinach and chicken pasta:** Chicken + spinach + pasta (+ buy: cream, parmesan)
3. **Black bean tacos:** Black beans + bell peppers (+ buy: tortillas, cheese, salsa)
4. **Thai curry:** Coconut milk + chicken (+ buy: curry paste, vegetables)

**Strategy 4: The Ingredient Overlap Method**

Choose recipes that share ingredients to reduce shopping list:

**Example - Choosing recipes with overlapping ingredients:**
- **Recipe 1:** Chicken tacos (chicken, peppers, onions, cilantro, lime)
- **Recipe 2:** Chicken stir-fry (chicken, peppers, onions, ginger, soy sauce)
- **Recipe 3:** Burrito bowls (same taco ingredients + rice + beans)

**Shared ingredients:** Chicken, peppers, onions  
**Benefit:** Buy in bulk, less waste, simpler shopping

#### C. Recipe Selection Criteria

**Easy Recipes Should Be:**
- ✅ 5-7 ingredients or less
- ✅ 30 minutes or less total time
- ✅ One pot or sheet pan
- ✅ Minimal chopping/prep
- ✅ Simple techniques (roasting, sautéing, etc.)

**Good Meal Prep Recipes Should Be:**
- ✅ Reheat well
- ✅ Don't get soggy
- ✅ Stable ingredients (not crispy or delicate)
- ✅ Taste good after a few days
- ✅ Portion easily

**Examples of Great Meal Prep Recipes:**
- Soups and stews
- Chili
- Grain bowls
- Roasted proteins and vegetables
- Pasta dishes
- Curries
- Casseroles

**Examples of Poor Meal Prep Recipes:**
- Fried foods (soggy when reheated)
- Salads with dressing (wilted and soggy)
- Delicate fish (texture degrades)
- Sandwiches (bread gets soggy)

#### D. Consider Leftovers Strategically

**Intentional Leftover Planning:**

**Option 1: Double It**
- Make 2x the recipe
- Eat half fresh, freeze half
- Or eat half, have leftovers 2 days later

**Option 2: Leftover Transformation**
- Monday: Roast chicken
- Wednesday: Chicken tacos (using leftover chicken)
- Or: Chicken salad, chicken soup, chicken quesadillas

**Option 3: Component Reuse**
- Sunday: Make large batch of rice
- Monday: Stir-fry over rice
- Wednesday: Burrito bowls with rice
- Friday: Fried rice with the remaining rice

**Option 4: Freezer Stash**
- Make extra portions
- Freeze immediately
- Build up variety in freezer
- Pull out as needed

#### E. Balance Nutrition

Ensure each meal includes:

**The Balanced Plate:**
- **50% Vegetables:** Non-starchy vegetables (broccoli, peppers, leafy greens, etc.)
- **25% Protein:** Chicken, fish, tofu, beans, eggs, etc.
- **25% Complex Carbs:** Brown rice, quinoa, sweet potato, whole grain pasta, etc.
- **Healthy Fat:** Olive oil, avocado, nuts, etc.

**Weekly Nutrition Checks:**
- ✅ Do I have vegetables with every dinner?
- ✅ Am I including a variety of proteins?
- ✅ Are most of my grains whole grains?
- ✅ Am I including beans/legumes at least once?
- ✅ Do I have colorful produce? (Different colors = different nutrients)

#### F. Keep It Real

**Be Honest About:**
- Your cooking skills (don't plan 5 complicated recipes)
- Your time (don't plan elaborate meals for busy nights)
- Your family's preferences (plan some crowd-pleasers)
- Your energy levels (Thursday after a long week? Plan something EASY)

**Plan for Flexibility:**
- Keep a "backup meal" in mind (pantry meal or freezer meal)
- It's okay to swap days around
- It's okay to order pizza if plans change
- Progress over perfection!

### Sample Week: Meal Plan Example

**Schedule Context:** Family of 4, both parents work, kids have activities Wed/Thu

```

## Step 3: Create Your Grocery List

**Time Required:** 15-20 minutes  
**When to Do It:** After planning menu, before shopping

A good grocery list is organized, complete, and prevents impulse buys.

### The Process

#### A. Extract Ingredients from Recipes

For each recipe on your plan:
1. Read the full recipe
2. Note the ingredients and quantities
3. Write them down

**Example:**

- 1 onion
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp ginger
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 3 cups cooked rice

#### B. Check Against Inventory

Go through your list:
- Cross off items you already have
- Adjust quantities if you have partial amounts

**Example Adjustments:**
- ~~3 cups cooked rice~~ (have leftover rice)
- ~~Soy sauce~~ (have in pantry)
- ~~1 onion~~ (have 3 onions)
- Need: 1.5 lbs chicken, 2 bell peppers, broccoli, garlic, ginger, sesame oil

#### C. Add Staples and Basics

**Breakfast Items:**
- Eggs

**Pantry Restocks:**
- Olive oil
- Spices running low
- Canned goods

#### D. Organize Your List by Store Section

**Why?** Shop more efficiently, less likely to forget items, avoid backtracking

**Typical Sections:**
1. **Produce**
2. **Meat/Seafood**
3. **Dairy/Eggs**
4. **Pantry/Dry Goods**
5. **Frozen**
6. **Bakery**
7. **Other**

**Organized List Example:**

```
PRODUCE:
☐ Bell peppers (3)
☐ Broccoli (1 head)
☐ Garlic (1 bulb)
☐ Ginger (small piece)
☐ Spinach (1 bunch)
☐ Tomatoes (4)
☐ Avocados (2)
☐ Bananas (1 bunch)
☐ Apples (6)

MEAT/SEAFOOD:
☐ Chicken breasts (3 lbs)
☐ Ground turkey (1 lb)
☐ Salmon fillets (1.5 lbs)

DAIRY/EGGS:

☐ Diced tomatoes (2 cans)
☐ Whole wheat pasta (1 lb)
☐ Tortillas (1 package)

FROZEN:
☐ Frozen peas (1 bag)

BAKERY:
☐ Whole grain bread (1 loaf)
```

#### E. Digital vs. Paper Lists

**Paper List:**
- **Pros:** Simple, tactile, can hand to partner
- **Cons:** Easy to lose, can't share remotely
- **Best for:** Traditional shoppers, those who prefer pen and paper

**Phone Notes App:**
- **Pros:** Always have your phone, can share with family
- **Cons:** Must type, screen glare in store
- **Best for:** Most people, simple and free

**Grocery List Apps:**
- **Examples:** AnyList, Out of Milk, Mealime, Paprika
- **Pros:** Organized by category automatically, shareable, save favorite lists
- **Cons:** Learning curve, some cost money
- **Best for:** Tech-savvy planners, families who share shopping duties

**Recommendation:** Start with whatever you'll actually use. Phone notes app is usually easiest to start.

### Pro Shopping List Tips

**1. Keep a Running List**
- Keep a list on the fridge or phone
- Add items as you run out during the week
- When planning time comes, you already have basics listed

**2. Save Standard Lists**
- Create a template of items you buy every week
- Just add recipe-specific items each week
- Saves time rewriting the same things

**3. Check Sales Before Planning**
- Look at store circular online
- Plan meals around what's on sale
- Significant savings over time

**4. Separate "Must Have" from "Nice to Have"**
- Mark essential items
- If over budget, cut the nice-to-haves
- Stay flexible

**5. Quantity Matters**
- Don't just write "chicken" - write "3 lbs chicken breast"
- Prevents multiple trips or having too little
- Especially important for recipes with specific amounts

## Step 4: Smart Grocery Shopping

**Time Required:** 45-90 minutes (depending on store and list size)  
**When to Do It:** 1-2 days before meal prep day

Good shopping habits save time and money.

### Before You Go

**Prep:**
- ✅ Eat something first (never shop hungry!)
- ✅ Check your list one more time
- ✅ Bring reusable bags
- ✅ Set a budget if needed
- ✅ Check for coupons/digital deals

**Best Times to Shop:**
- **Weekday mornings:** Least crowded, fresh stock
- **Weekday late evenings:** Less crowded (but stock may be picked over)
- **Avoid:** Weekend afternoons (most crowded), Sunday evenings (picked over)

### Shopping Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Shop the Perimeter First

**The Perimeter = Whole Foods**
- Produce
- Meat and seafood
- Dairy
- Bakery

**Why?** These are your healthiest, most essential items. Get them first while you have energy and focus.

**The Middle Aisles = Processed Foods**
- Only go down aisles you need
- Stick to your list
- More opportunities for impulse buys

#### Strategy 2: Follow Your Organized List

- Shop in the order of your list
- Check off items as you go
- Reduces backtracking and forgotten items

#### Strategy 3: Buy Seasonal Produce

**Benefits:**
- Better flavor
- Better prices
- Better quality
- More nutrients (hasn't traveled as far)

**How to Know What's in Season:**
- Look for sale signs (usually indicates in season)
- Notice what's abundant and colorful
- Check seasonal produce guides online
- Ask produce staff

**General Guidelines:**
- **Spring:** Asparagus, peas, strawberries, lettuce
- **Summer:** Tomatoes, corn, zucchini, berries, stone fruits
- **Fall:** Squash, apples, pears, Brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes
- **Winter:** Citrus, root vegetables, cabbage, winter squash

#### Strategy 4: Quality Over Perfection

**Where to Prioritize Quality:**
- Proteins (especially if eating lean)
- Items you eat raw or with skins (berries, apples, peppers)
- Staple items you use frequently

**Where You Can Save:**
- Frozen vegetables (just as nutritious as fresh!)
- Canned beans and tomatoes
- Generic/store brands for pantry staples
- "Ugly" produce (same nutrition, lower price)

#### Strategy 5: Buy in Bulk (Strategically)

**Good Bulk Buys:**
- ✅ Non-perishables you use regularly (rice, pasta, oats, nuts)
- ✅ Frozen items (vegetables, fruit for smoothies)
- ✅ Proteins you can freeze (chicken, ground beef)
- ✅ Items on deep discount

**Bad Bulk Buys:**
- ❌ Perishable items you won't use in time
- ❌ New foods you haven't tried yet
- ❌ Highly processed snacks (encourages overeating)
- ❌ Items you're buying just because "it's a good deal"

**Ask Yourself:** "Will I realistically use all of this before it goes bad?"

#### Strategy 6: Check Unit Prices

**What Are Unit Prices?**
- Small labels on shelves showing price per ounce, pound, or unit
- Allows comparison between different sizes and brands

**Example:**
- Brand A: $3.99 for 16 oz = $0.25/oz
- Brand B: $4.99 for 32 oz = $0.16/oz
- **Brand B is cheaper per ounce** even though it costs more upfront

**Use This For:**
- Comparing different brands
- Deciding which size to buy
- Finding the best deals

#### Strategy 7: Beware of Marketing Tricks

**Common Traps:**
- **End caps:** Not always sales, just premium positioning
- **Eye level:** Most expensive brands (look high and low for deals)
- **"Buy 2 Get 1":** Only a deal if you need multiple
- **Pre-packaged "convenience":** Often overpriced (pre-cut fruit, pre-made meals)

**Candy at checkout:** Impulse buy zone - be strong!

#### Strategy 8: Read Labels Quickly

**For Health:**
- Check ingredients list (fewer = better)
- Check sodium content (compare brands)
- Check added sugars
- Avoid partially hydrogenated oils (trans fats)

**For Value:**
- Check price per unit
- Check weight/size
- Compare store brand to name brand

### Money-Saving Shopping Tips

**1. Use Store Loyalty Programs**
- Free to join
- Digital coupons automatically applied
- Earn points or cash back
- Get sale notifications

**2. Compare Store Prices**
- Some stores are cheaper for produce
- Some for meat
- Some for packaged goods
- Consider shopping at 2 stores if savings significant

**3. Buy Store Brands**
- Usually 20-30% cheaper
- Often same quality (sometimes made in same facility as name brand)
- Especially good for: canned goods, pasta, rice, frozen vegetables, dairy

**4. Use Coupons (Strategically)**
- Digital coupons from store app
- Manufacturer coupons (but don't buy things you don't need!)
- Stack store + manufacturer coupons when possible

**5. Check the "Manager's Special" Section**
- Meat near sell-by date (discounted 30-50%)
- Cook or freeze immediately
- Baked goods (freeze extra bread)
- Produce (use within 1-2 days)

**6. Avoid Convenience Foods**
- Pre-cut vegetables: 200-300% markup
- Pre-made salads: 400%+ markup
- Individual portions: Much more expensive than bulk
- **Do the prep yourself** to save significantly

**7. Don't Overbuy Perishables**
- Better to run out and grab more than waste food
- Frozen vegetables are cheaper and last longer than fresh
- Start conservative, adjust based on actual consumption

### What to Do at Checkout

**Before Paying:**
- Quick scan: Did you forget anything critical?
- Remove any impulse adds that aren't on your list
- Have your list and coupons ready

**After Paying:**
- Check receipt for errors (happens!)
- Put cold items together for transport home
- Get groceries home and unpacked within an hour (especially meat and dairy)

### When You Get Home

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Put away cold items first** (meat, dairy, frozen)
2. **Store meat properly** (bottom shelf, in containers if needed)
3. **Wash and prep produce** (if you have time/energy):
   - Wash berries (with vinegar rinse for longer life)
   - Wash and dry lettuce (store with paper towel)
   - Chop vegetables for snacking
4. **Check your meal plan** and confirm you have everything
5. **Do quick prep** if you have energy:
   - Marinate proteins for tomorrow
   - Portion snacks
   - Make overnight oats

**Or:** Just put it all away and save prep for your designated prep day. That's fine too!

---

## Step 5: Meal Prep Execution

**Time Required:** 1-4 hours (depending on your chosen style and # of meals)  
**When to Do It:** Usually Sunday, but choose what works for you

This is where you actually prepare the food for the week. The amount of prep varies based on your chosen meal planning style (from Section 2).

### Before You Start

**Set Yourself Up for Success:**

**1. Clear Your Schedule**
- Block 2-3 hours minimum
- Tell family you'll be busy
- Put on music, podcast, or audiobook
- Make it enjoyable!

**2. Clean and Clear Your Kitchen**
- Empty the sink
- Clear counter space
- Run the dishwasher before you start (empty it during prep)
- Take out the trash

**3. Gather Your Equipment**
- Cutting boards
- Knives
- Pots and pans
- Baking sheets
- Storage containers
- Labels and markers

**4. Review Your Plan**
- Pull up all recipes
- Know what you're making
- Mentally walk through the process

**5. Fuel Yourself**
- Eat a meal or snack first
- Have water nearby
- Don't start when exhausted

### The Prep Process: Order Matters!

**Efficient Order of Operations:**

#### Phase 1: Oven Tasks (Start First - 45-60 min)
These take longest and don't require much attention.

1. **Preheat oven to highest temp needed** (you can adjust down)
2. **Prep and roast vegetables:**
   - Chop all roasting vegetables
   - Toss with oil and seasonings
   - Arrange on baking sheets
   - Into the oven (400-425°F for 25-35 min)
3. **Bake proteins if roasting:**
   - Chicken breasts, salmon, etc.
   - Can roast on same sheet pan as vegetables

**While oven items cook, move to Phase 2.**

#### Phase 2: Stovetop Tasks (Medium Priority - 20-40 min)
Things that need attention but cook relatively quickly.

4. **Start grains cooking:**
   - Rice, quinoa, pasta, etc.
   - Set timer
   - Requires minimal attention

5. **Boil eggs** (if making hard-boiled eggs):
   - Set timer
   - Can do other prep while boiling

6. **Make sauces or dressings:**
   - Quick task between other items

**While these cook, move to Phase 3.**

#### Phase 3: Slow Cooker/Instant Pot (Hands-Off)
If making slow cooker or pressure cooker meals:

7. **Prep and start slow cooker meals** (if serving later in week)
8. **Prep Instant Pot meals** (can cook now or store ingredients together to cook later)

#### Phase 4: Chopping and Prep Work (Active Time)
These tasks fill the gaps while other things cook.

9. **Wash and chop all vegetables:**
   - Salad vegetables
   - Snack vegetables (carrots, celery, peppers)
   - Vegetables for future recipes
   - Store in containers or bags

10. **Prep proteins for later in week:**
    - Marinate chicken for Wednesday dinner
    - Season and portion fish
    - Brown ground meat (if using this week)

11. **Prep breakfast items:**
    - Overnight oats in jars
    - Egg muffins (bake while other items in oven)
    - Cut fruit
    - Portion snacks

#### Phase 5: Assembly and Storage (Final 20-30 min)
Everything is cooked, now put it together.

12. **Let cooked items cool** (10-15 min):
    - Don't put hot food in containers (creates condensation/sogginess)
    - Don't refrigerate hot food (raises fridge temp)

13. **Portion proteins:**
    - Slice chicken, portion fish
    - Store in individual or meal-sized portions

14. **Portion grains:**
    - Measure into containers or bags
    - Label with contents and date

15. **Assemble complete meals** (if doing full meal prep):
    - Protein + grain + vegetables
    - Keep dressings/sauces separate
    - Label each container

16. **Store everything properly:**
    - Refrigerate meals for first 3-4 days
    - Freeze meals for later in week
    - Label everything with contents and date

#### Phase 6: Cleanup
17. **Clean as you go** (ideally):
    - Load dishwasher throughout
    - Wipe counters
    - Put away food

18. **Final cleanup:**
    - Wash remaining dishes
    - Wipe down all surfaces
    - Take out trash
    - Put everything away

### Multi-Tasking Like a Pro

**The Secret: Cook Multiple Things Simultaneously**

**Example Multi-Tasking Schedule (2-hour session):**

```

- Start eggs boiling (set timer for 12 min)
- Chop vegetables for salads/snacks (store)

0:30 - Oven timer goes off
- Flip/stir roasted vegetables
- Back in oven for 10-15 more minutes

0:35 - Continue Prep
- Drain and peel eggs
- Drain rice when done
- Prep chicken breasts with seasoning

0:45 - Final Oven Round
- Remove fully roasted vegetables
- Put seasoned chicken in oven (20 min)
- Make salad dressing while waiting

1:05 - Assembly
- Remove chicken from oven
- Let everything cool 10 minutes
- Wash pots and pans

1:15 - Portioning
- Slice chicken
- Portion rice, vegetables, chicken into containers
- Portion snacks
- Label everything

1:45 - Storage & Cleanup
- Store in fridge/freezer
- Final cleanup
- Wipe counters

2:00 - Done!
```

**Result:** 4-5 dinners prepped, lunches ready, snacks portioned, kitchen clean. Time well spent!

- Glass containers or freezer bags
- Label clearly (all look the same frozen!)

**For Keeping Things Crispy:**
- Store separate from wet ingredients
- Add just before eating
- Examples: Tortilla chips, croutons, crispy toppings

### Labeling System

**Minimum Information:**
- **Contents:** "Chicken and rice bowl"
- **Date:** "Prepared 10/26"

**Helpful Additional Info:**
- **Eat by date:** "Eat by 10/29"
- **Reheating instructions:** "Microwave 2 min"
- **Calories/macros:** (if tracking)

**Labeling Tools:**
- Masking tape + Sharpie (cheapest)
- Label maker
- Erasable labels
- Dry-erase marker on containers

### Troubleshooting Common Meal Prep Problems

**Problem: Food gets soggy**
- **Solution:** Store wet and dry ingredients separately; add sauce/dressing right before eating

**Problem: Running out of time**
- **Solution:** Start with less ambitious plan; focus on 2-3 recipes max

**Problem: Running out of containers**
- **Solution:** Reuse containers you already have; buy a basic set if continuing

**Problem: Forgetting to defrost frozen meals**
- **Solution:** Move to fridge night before; set phone reminder

**Problem: Getting tired/burnt out mid-prep**
- **Solution:** Take breaks; spread prep over 2 days; simplify your plan

**Problem: Food doesn't taste good by end of week**
- **Solution:** Freeze meals 4-5; eat fresh meals 1-3; choose recipes that hold up better
