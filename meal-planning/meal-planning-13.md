## Meeting Macronutrient Goals

### Understanding Macros

**Three Macronutrients:**
1. Protein
2. Carbohydrates
3. Fat

**Each Has Different Functions and Calorie Values:**
- Protein: 4 calories per gram
- Carbohydrates: 4 calories per gram
- Fat: 9 calories per gram

### Protein Goals

#### General Population

**Minimum:**
- 0.8g per kg body weight (sedentary)
- 150 lb person = 54g protein per day minimum

**Optimal:**
- 1.2-1.6g per kg body weight
- 150 lb person = 82-109g protein per day

**Athletes/Very Active:**
- 1.6-2.2g per kg body weight
- 150 lb person = 109-150g protein per day

#### Distributing Protein Throughout Day

**Better Than All at Once:**
- 20-30g protein per meal
- 3-4 meals per day
- Stimulates muscle protein synthesis
- Keeps you full

**Meal Prep Application:**

**Example: 120g protein/day goal**
- Breakfast: 25g (3 eggs + Greek yogurt)
- Lunch: 30g (5 oz chicken)
- Snack: 15g (protein shake)
- Dinner: 35g (6 oz salmon)
- Snack: 15g (cottage cheese)
**Total: 120g**

### Carbohydrate Considerations

#### Not One-Size-Fits-All

**Factors:**
- Activity level
- Goals (weight loss vs. performance)
- Individual response
- Personal preference

**General Ranges:**
- Sedentary: 100-150g per day
- Moderately active: 150-250g per day
- Very active/athlete: 250-400g+ per day
- Low-carb diet: <100g per day
- Ketogenic: <50g per day

#### Timing Carbs

**For Active Individuals:**
- More carbs around workouts (fuel and recovery)
- Pre-workout meal: Include carbs
- Post-workout meal: Include carbs
- Other meals: Can be lower carb

**Meal Prep Application:**
- Vary grain portions based on workout schedule
- Workout days: Full portion (1 cup) rice/grains
- Rest days: Half portion (1/2 cup) or more vegetables

#### Choosing Quality Carbs

**Prioritize:**
- Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats)
- Starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, potatoes, squash)
- Legumes (beans, lentils)
- Fruit

**Limit:**
- Refined grains (white bread, white rice)
- Added sugars
- Processed snacks

**Why:** Whole food carbs provide fiber, vitamins, minerals vs. empty calories

### Fat Goals

#### Essential, Don't Fear

**Minimum:**
- 0.5g per kg body weight
- 150 lb person = 34g fat per day minimum

**Optimal:**
- 0.8-1.2g per kg body weight
- 150 lb person = 54-82g fat per day

**Or as Percentage:**
- 20-35% of total calories from fat

#### Fat Distribution

**Spread Throughout Day:**
- Use for cooking (olive oil, butter)
- Add to salads (dressing, avocado, nuts)
- Snacks (nuts, nut butter)
- Fatty proteins (salmon, eggs)

**Easy to Hit Fat Goals:**
- 1 tbsp oil in cooking = 14g fat
- 1/2 avocado = 15g fat
- 1 oz nuts = 14-18g fat
- Adds up quickly!

#### Focus on Healthy Fats

**Prioritize:**
- Monounsaturated (olive oil, avocado, nuts)
- Polyunsaturated (fatty fish, walnuts, flax)
- Omega-3s (salmon, sardines, chia seeds)

**Limit:**
- Saturated fat (moderate amounts OK)
- Trans fats (avoid completely)

---

## Meal Timing Considerations

### Does Meal Timing Matter?

**The Research:**
- Total daily intake matters MOST
- Timing is secondary but can help
- Individual variation exists

**When Timing Helps:**
- Athletes (performance and recovery)
- Blood sugar management
- Appetite control
- Circadian rhythm optimization

### Breakfast: To Eat or Not?

**Pro-Breakfast Arguments:**
- "Kickstarts" metabolism (minor effect)
- Prevents overeating later
- Better blood sugar control
- Cultural norm

**Skip-Breakfast Arguments:**
- Intermittent fasting benefits
- Not hungry in morning
- Saves time
- Preference

**Verdict:** Do what works for YOU
- Hungry in morning? Eat breakfast
- Not hungry? Don't force it
- Performance matters? Fuel appropriately

### Pre-Workout Nutrition

**1-2 Hours Before Exercise:**
- Carbs for energy
- Moderate protein
- Lower fat (digests slowly)

**Example:**
- Banana with peanut butter
- Oatmeal with berries
- Turkey sandwich

**30 Minutes Before:**
- Small, easily digestible carbs
- Banana, apple, energy bar

**Meal Prep Application:**
- Have quick pre-workout options ready
- Granola bars, fruit, energy bites
- Convenient grab-and-go

### Post-Workout Nutrition

**Within 1-2 Hours After Exercise:**
- Protein for muscle recovery
- Carbs to replenish glycogen
- 3:1 or 4:1 carb to protein ratio ideal

**Example:**
- Chicken and rice bowl
- Protein shake with banana
- Greek yogurt with granola

**Meal Prep Application:**
- Have post-workout meal ready
- Quick reheat or cold meal
- Don't skip this meal!

### Evening Eating

**Myth: "Don't eat after 7pm"**
- Not true!
- Total daily calories matter more
- Eating late doesn't cause fat gain (excess calories do)

**Considerations:**
- Some people sleep better without full stomach
- Others need evening snack
- Personal preference

**Meal Prep Application:**
- Include dinner in meal prep
- Have healthy evening snacks ready (if needed)
- Greek yogurt, fruit, nuts

---

## Special Nutrition Considerations

**Reality:**
- Not every meal will be perfectly balanced
- 80/20 rule: 80% nutritious, 20% flexibility
- Consistency over perfection
- Long-term matters more than one meal

### 2. Listen to Your Body

**Hunger and Fullness Cues:**
- Eat when hungry
- Stop when satisfied (not stuffed)
- Adjust portions based on activity
- Everyone's needs differ

### 3. Flexibility Within Structure

**Meal Prep Provides Structure:**
- But be flexible
- Hungrier some days? Larger portions
- Less hungry? Smaller portions or skip snack
- Honor your body

### 4. Don't Stress About Every Detail

**Prioritize the Big Rocks:**
1. Adequate protein
2. Plenty of vegetables
3. Whole food carbs
4. Healthy fats
5. Variety and color

**If you do these, you're 90% there!**

### 5. Supplements Are Supplements, Not Replacements

**Focus on Food First:**
- Whole foods > supplements
- Food has synergistic nutrients
- Supplements fill specific gaps only

**Common Helpful Supplements:**
- Vitamin D (hard to get from food)
- Omega-3s (if don't eat fish)
- B12 (for vegans)
- Multivitamin (insurance policy)

**Consult healthcare provider before starting**
