Now let's dive deep into the specific techniques for prepping different types of food. This section will teach you how to prepare proteins, grains, vegetables, sauces, and snacks efficiently and properly.

## Prepping Proteins

Protein is often the most expensive and time-consuming part of meal prep. Master these techniques and you'll save significant time and money.

### Chicken

Chicken is the most versatile and popular protein for meal prep. Here are multiple methods:

#### Method 1: Oven-Baked Chicken Breasts

**Best For:** Slicing for salads, bowls, wraps, sandwiches

**Process:**
1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C)
2. **Pound chicken** to even thickness (prevents dry edges)
3. **Season both sides:** Salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika (or your favorite blend)
4. **Arrange** on baking sheet lined with parchment paper
5. **Bake** 25-30 minutes until internal temp reaches 165°F
6. **Rest** 5-10 minutes before slicing
7. **Cool completely** before storing

**Yield:** 3 lbs raw = about 2 lbs cooked (8-10 servings)

**Storage:** 
- Refrigerate: 3-4 days
- Freeze: Up to 3 months

**Pro Tips:**
- Don't overcook (dry chicken is sad chicken)
- Use meat thermometer for precision
- Brine for 30 minutes before cooking (1/4 cup salt per 4 cups water) for extra juicy chicken

#### Method 2: Slow Cooker Shredded Chicken

**Best For:** Tacos, soups, casseroles, chicken salad, BBQ chicken

**Process:**
1. **Place chicken breasts** (2-4 lbs) in slow cooker
2. **Add liquid:** 1 cup chicken broth, salsa, or BBQ sauce
3. **Season:** Taco seasoning, Italian herbs, or leave plain
4. **Cook:** Low 6-8 hours or High 3-4 hours
5. **Shred** with two forks
6. **Cool** before storing

**Yield:** 3 lbs raw = about 5-6 cups shredded

**Storage:**
- Refrigerate: 3-4 days
- Freeze: Up to 4 months (store with some liquid to prevent drying)

**Pro Tips:**
- Can cook from frozen (add 1-2 hours)
- Store shredded chicken in its cooking liquid (stays moist)
- Portion into 1-2 cup servings before freezing

#### Method 3: Grilled Chicken

**Best For:** Maximum flavor, summer cooking, meal bowls

**Process:**
1. **Marinate** (optional but recommended): 2-4 hours or overnight
2. **Preheat grill** to medium-high (400°F)

- Eat-by date
- Reheating instructions (optional)

**5. Strategic Refrigerator Organization**
- Oldest items in front

- Snacks at eye level
- Raw meat on bottom shelf

**6. Don't Prep Everything**
- Some things taste better fresh
- Some things don't store well
- Find your balance

**7. Start Small**
