Quick answers to the most common meal planning questions. Use this as a reference when you need fast solutions.

---

## Getting Started Questions

### Q: How do I start meal planning if I've never done it before?

**A:** Start ridiculously small:
- Plan just 3 dinners for the week (not all 7)
- Keep meals simple (5 ingredients or less)
- Choose one prep day (usually Sunday)
- Make a shopping list from those 3 meals
- Do this for 2-3 weeks before adding more

**Success tip:** Don't try to plan every meal immediately. Master dinner planning first, then add other meals gradually.

---

### Q: How long does meal planning actually take?

**A:** Time investment:
- **Planning:** 15-30 minutes (choosing meals, making list)
- **Shopping:** 30-60 minutes (depends on store)
- **Prep:** 2-4 hours initially → 1.5-2.5 hours once experienced

**Total:** 3-5.5 hours per week initially, 2-4 hours once you have a system.

**But you save:** 6-11 hours/week compared to daily shopping and deciding what to eat.

---

### Q: Do I need to prep ALL my meals on Sunday?

**A:** Absolutely not! Options:
- **Full prep:** Cook everything Sunday (2-4 hours)
- **Partial prep:** Prep components only, cook fresh (1-2 hours)
- **Minimal prep:** Just chop vegetables and marinate proteins (30-60 min)
- **Split prep:** Half Sunday, half Wednesday (1-2 hours each)
- **Daily light prep:** 10-15 minutes each evening for next day

Choose what fits your lifestyle. There's no "right" way.

---

### Q: What if I have zero cooking skills?

**A:** Perfect for meal planning! Start with:
- **No-cook meals:** Sandwiches, salads, yogurt parfaits
- **One-pot meals:** Dump everything in slow cooker or Instant Pot
- **Sheet pan meals:** Everything on one pan in oven
- **3-ingredient recipes:** Can't be too complicated
- **Rotisserie chicken:** Pre-cooked protein you just reheat

**Reality:** Meal planning actually helps you develop cooking skills because you practice regularly with a plan.

---

### Q: How much does meal planning cost?

**A:** Initial investment:
- **Containers:** $20-50 (one-time)
- **Basic tools:** $30-100 if starting from scratch (one-time)
- **Food:** Same as you're spending now, often LESS

**Savings:** Most people save $200-400/month by:
- Not eating out as much
- Reducing food waste
- Avoiding impulse purchases
- Buying in bulk strategically

**Break-even:** Usually in first month from reduced takeout alone.

---

## Planning Process Questions

### Q: How many meals should I plan for the week?

**A:** Depends on your goal:
- **Beginners:** 3-4 dinners only
- **Intermediate:** 5-6 dinners + breakfasts
- **Advanced:** All meals including snacks

**Leave buffer:** Plan for 5-6 dinners even if you need 7. Life happens—you'll eat leftovers, go out, or order pizza. Don't over-plan.

---

### Q: Should I plan the same meals every week?

**A:** Two approaches work:
1. **Rotation method:** 3-4 weeks of different meals, then repeat cycle (12-16 recipes total)
2. **Variety method:** New meals weekly or mix of favorites + new recipes

**Reality check:** Most families actually eat the same 15-20 meals repeatedly anyway. Meal planning just makes it intentional.

**Best approach:** Mix of both—keep 60% favorites you rotate, 40% new or seasonal recipes.

---

### Q: How do I plan meals my whole family will eat?

**A:** Strategies:
- **Include everyone:** Let each person choose one meal
- **Deconstructed meals:** Taco bar, pasta bar, bowl-style meals where everyone customizes
- **One-bite rule:** Everyone tries everything, no forcing
- **Backup options:** Raw vegetables, bread, fruit for picky eaters
- **Gradual introduction:** New foods alongside familiar favorites

**Don't be a short-order cook:** Make one meal. If kids don't like it, they can have simple alternatives (PB&J, cereal, yogurt) they make themselves.

---

### Q: What if I don't know what meals to make?

**A:** Build your meal bank:
1. **Write down** 10 meals you already make and like
2. **Ask friends** for their go-to meals (add 5 more)
3. **Search online** for "easy [protein] recipes" (add 5 more)
4. **Now you have 20 meals** to rotate

**Use themes:** If still stuck, use theme nights—Meatless Monday, Taco Tuesday, Pasta Wednesday, etc. Themes make decisions automatic.

**Pinterest/Instagram:** Follow meal prep accounts for constant inspiration.

---

### Q: How do I plan for dietary restrictions?

**A:** Approaches:
- **Everyone eats the special diet:** Easiest—whole family eats gluten-free, dairy-free, etc.
- **Component cooking:** Make base meal adaptable (plain grilled chicken + multiple side options)
- **Parallel meals:** Cook two versions (regular pasta + gluten-free pasta)
- **Modification strategy:** Make main meal, modify portions (family gets cheese, one person doesn't)

**Reality:** Component cooking is most practical long-term. Cook proteins and sides separately so everyone can customize.

---

### Q: Do I need fancy meal prep containers?

**A:** No. Options by budget:
- **Free:** Save takeout containers, pasta sauce jars, yogurt containers
- **Cheap ($10-20):** Plastic Rubbermaid or Glad containers from grocery store
- **Mid-range ($30-50):** Glass Pyrex or meal prep specific containers from Amazon
- **Premium ($50+):** Fancy divided containers, stainless steel, bento boxes

**Start with what you have.** Upgrade later if needed. Proper containers make meal prep easier but aren't required to start.

---

## Food Safety & Storage Questions

### Q: How long does meal prepped food last in the fridge?

**A:** General guidelines:
- **Cooked chicken/turkey:** 3-4 days
- **Cooked beef/pork:** 3-4 days
- **Cooked fish/seafood:** 2-3 days (prep Wednesday for Thursday-Friday)
- **Cooked grains/pasta:** 4-5 days
- **Cooked vegetables:** 4-5 days
- **Raw vegetables (chopped):** 3-4 days
- **Salads with dressing:** 1-2 days
- **Salads without dressing:** 3-4 days

**Rule of thumb:** If prepping Sunday, eat fish by Tuesday, everything else by Thursday. Freeze anything for Friday-Sunday.

---

### Q: Can I freeze meal prepped food?

**A:** Yes! Freezing guidelines:
- **Freezes well:** Soups, stews, chili, casseroles, cooked grains, cooked proteins, burritos, pasta with sauce
- **Freezes okay:** Pasta without sauce, cooked vegetables (texture changes but safe)
- **Don't freeze:** Lettuce, raw vegetables, mayo-based sauces, fried foods, soft cheeses

**Storage time:** 2-3 months for best quality, up to 6 months for safety.

**Tip:** Freeze in individual portions. Thaw overnight in fridge or use defrost setting on microwave.

---

### Q: How do I prevent soggy meal prep?

**A:** Strategies:
- **Separate wet and dry:** Keep dressing, sauce, or moist ingredients in separate container until eating
- **Cool completely:** Never put hot food in containers—creates condensation
- **Paper towel trick:** Place paper towel in container to absorb excess moisture
- **Vent containers:** Leave lid slightly open first few hours in fridge to release steam
- **Right container:** Use containers with sections/dividers
- **Strategic packing:** Put wet items (tomatoes, dressing) on bottom, dry items (lettuce, chips) on top

---

### Q: Is it safe to reheat rice?

**A:** Yes, if done properly:
- **Cool quickly:** Refrigerate within 1 hour of cooking
- **Store cold:** Keep at 40°F or below
- **Reheat thoroughly:** To 165°F (steaming hot throughout)
- **Reheat once only:** Don't reheat multiple times
- **Use within:** 3-4 days

**Safety note:** Rice can contain bacteria (Bacillus cereus) that survives cooking. Proper cooling and storage prevents bacterial growth.

**Best practice:** Portion rice immediately after cooking, cool quickly in shallow containers, refrigerate promptly.

---

### Q: Can I meal prep without a microwave?

**A:** Absolutely! Options:
- **Stovetop:** Reheat in pan with splash of water (5-7 minutes)
- **Oven:** Reheat at 350°F for 15-20 minutes covered
- **Toaster oven:** Works like regular oven, smaller portions
- **Cold meals:** Salads, sandwiches, wraps, overnight oats (no reheating needed)
- **Thermos:** Pour hot soup/stew into thermos in morning, stays hot until lunch

**Meal prep strategy:** Focus on meals that taste good cold or at room temperature, or pack meals that can be heated at work/school on stovetop.

---

## Time & Efficiency Questions

### Q: I don't have 3-4 hours on Sunday. Now what?

**A:** Alternatives:
- **Split sessions:** 1.5 hours Sunday + 1.5 hours Wednesday
- **Evening prep:** 20-30 minutes after dinner each night for next day
- **Minimal prep:** Prep ingredients only (chop vegetables, marinate protein), cook fresh in 20-30 minutes
- **Batch cook once monthly:** Once-a-month cooking (OAMC), freeze everything, thaw as needed
- **Half week:** Only prep Monday-Wednesday on Sunday (1-2 hours)

**Reality:** Most people doing "meal planning" aren't doing 4-hour Sunday meal prep. They're doing lighter versions that fit their schedule.

---

### Q: How do I meal prep faster?

**A:** Speed strategies:
- **Multi-task:** Use oven, stovetop, and Instant Pot simultaneously
- **Batch cook:** Triple recipes, freeze extras
- **Pre-prepped ingredients:** Buy pre-chopped vegetables, rotisserie chicken, frozen rice
- **One-pan meals:** Everything cooks together (sheet pan dinners, stir-fries)
- **Simplify recipes:** Stick to 5-ingredient meals
- **Same base, different toppings:** Cook plain chicken, use different sauces/seasonings
- **Assembly line method:** Do all chopping at once, all cooking at once, all portioning at once

**Experience matters:** You'll naturally get faster. First time = 4 hours. After 8 weeks = 2 hours.

---

### Q: What's the fastest meal to prep?

**A:** Ultra-quick options:
- **Overnight oats:** 5 minutes (just mix ingredients)
- **Mason jar salads:** 10 minutes (layer ingredients)
- **Burritos:** 15 minutes with pre-cooked filling
- **Smoothie packs:** 10 minutes (portion ingredients in bags, freeze)
- **Egg muffins:** 20 minutes (mix, pour, bake)
- **No-cook snack boxes:** 5 minutes (cheese, crackers, fruit, nuts)

**Fastest full meal:** Sheet pan dinner—everything on one pan, 10 minutes prep + 25 minutes cooking = 35 minutes for 4 servings.

---

### Q: Can I meal prep if I work long/irregular hours?

**A:** Yes! Adapt the approach:
- **Flexible portions:** Make components that can be eaten any time (not specific "Monday meal")
- **Freezer-heavy:** Freeze most meals, thaw 1-2 days at a time based on schedule
- **Grab-and-go:** Focus on portable meals you can eat anywhere, anytime
- **Morning decision:** Decide that morning what to eat based on that day's schedule
- **Weekend prep:** Prep when you have time, not necessarily Sunday
- **Emergency backup:** Always keep 3-4 freezer meals for crazy weeks

**Reality:** Meal planning is even MORE valuable with irregular schedule because decision-making is already done.

---

## Challenge & Troubleshooting Questions

### Q: What if I get bored eating the same meals?

**A:** Prevention strategies:
- **Variety in prep:** Don't make 5 servings of the same meal. Make 2-3 different meals
- **Same base, different toppings:** Cook chicken 3 ways with different sauces
- **Component cooking:** Mix and match components daily for "different" meals
- **Rotation:** 3-4 week rotation means 21-28 different dinners before repeating
- **One new recipe weekly:** Keep 80% familiar, 20% new
- **Spice/sauce variety:** Same meal tastes different with different seasoning

**Mindset shift:** You probably already eat repetitive meals without meal planning. Planning just makes it intentional and ensures variety.

---

### Q: My family complains about "leftovers."

**A:** Reframe and transform:
- **Call them "planned-overs"** not leftovers
- **Transform meals:** Monday's chicken becomes Tuesday's chicken tacos, Wednesday's chicken soup
- **Fresh elements:** Add fresh toppings (herbs, cheese, avocado, sour cream) when serving
- **Different presentation:** Monday's bowl becomes Tuesday's wrap
- **Two-day max rule:** Don't eat same meal more than 2 days in a row
- **Freeze immediately:** After eating once, freeze remainder—feels "new" when eating 2 weeks later

**Family involvement:** Let them choose meals for the week. Less complaining when they picked it.

---

### Q: I always forget to defrost food!

**A:** Solutions:
- **Phone reminders:** Set alarm for 8pm "Move tomorrow's dinner to fridge"
- **Morning routine:** Check freezer every morning, move to fridge
- **Visual cues:** Sticky note on coffee maker "Check freezer!"
- **Reduce freezing:** Only freeze Friday-Sunday meals, keep Monday-Thursday in fridge
- **Quick-thaw methods:** Use Instant Pot frozen setting, or cold water bath (30-60 minutes)
- **Fridge rotation:** Sunday night, move 2-3 meals from freezer to fridge for the week

**Best method:** Morning routine. Check freezer while coffee brews, move to fridge, done.

---

### Q: Meal prep is making me waste MORE food. Why?

**A:** Common causes + fixes:
- **Over-planning:** Planning 7 dinners when you need 5 → **Plan 5-6 max**
- **Too much variety:** Making 6 different meals → **Make 2-3 meals, multiple servings each**
- **Not eating it:** Meals taste bad or are inconvenient → **Prep foods you WANT to eat**
- **Forgetting it's there:** Meals hidden in fridge → **Keep visible, front and center**
- **Prepping wrong items:** Prepping ingredients you don't actually use → **Track what you waste, stop buying it**

**Solution:** Start smaller. Prep 50% of what you think you need. Adjust based on actual consumption.

---

### Q: My schedule changes week to week. Can I still meal plan?

**A:** Absolutely! Flexible approach:
- **Stock freezer:** Keep 10-15 frozen meals, pick based on week's schedule
- **Plan day-of:** Sunday morning, look at week's schedule, plan accordingly
- **Flex days:** Build in 2-3 "flex" days for eating out, leftovers, or changing plans
- **Simple swaps:** Make meals that can switch days easily (not perishable)
- **Component prep:** Prep ingredients, not complete meals—more flexibility
- **Rolling plan:** Plan 3 days ahead, not full week

**Reality:** Perfect meal plan that gets followed is impossible. Build flexibility into your system.

---

### Q: What do I do with food I prepped but don't want to eat?

**A:** Options:
1. **Freeze it:** Save for later when you're in the mood
2. **Transform it:** Add different sauce/seasonings to change flavor
3. **Give it away:** Offer to coworker, friend, or neighbor
4. **Compost/dispose:** If it's truly inedible, throw it out and learn for next time
5. **Feed pets:** If safe for pets and not seasoned

**Prevention:** Taste test new recipes before batch cooking. Make 1 serving first, then decide if you want 5 more.

**Learn from it:** Note what you didn't like, don't make again. Your meal plan should evolve based on preferences.

---

### Q: Is meal planning worth it for one person?

**A:** Absolutely! Benefits for singles:
- **Less waste:** Buy exactly what you need
- **Cheaper:** No thrown-away produce or expired food
- **Saves time:** No daily "what should I eat?" decisions
- **Healthier:** Less temptation to order takeout
- **Better variety:** Intentional planning = more diverse eating

**Singles-specific strategies:**
- Freeze half of everything immediately
- Cook once, eat multiple ways (roast chicken → 3-4 different meals)
- Embrace meal prep swaps with friends (cook double, trade)
- Shop from bulk bins (buy exact quantities needed)

**Reality:** Singles often waste MORE food than families because of package sizes. Meal planning combats this.

---

## Budget Questions

### Q: Does meal planning really save money?

**A:** For most people, yes:
- **Reduced takeout:** Biggest savings—$15-20 per meal saved
- **Less food waste:** Average family wastes $1,500/year in thrown-away food
- **Strategic shopping:** Buying only what you need, using sales
- **Bulk buying:** When it makes sense (frequently used items)

**Typical savings:** $200-400/month for family of 4

**Not always cheaper:** If you currently eat very cheap (ramen, rice and beans), meal planning might cost the same but improve nutrition.

---

### Q: How can I meal plan on a tiny budget?

**A:** Strategies:
- **Cheap proteins:** Eggs ($3-5/dozen = 12 meals), beans ($1/can), chicken thighs ($1-2/lb), ground turkey on sale
- **Seasonal produce:** Whatever's cheapest that week
- **Skip fancy ingredients:** Basic meals work fine
- **Batch cook grains:** Rice, pasta, oats are pennies per serving
- **Meatless meals:** 2-3 nights per week saves $20-30
- **Store brands:** Save 20-40% on identical products
- **Shop sales:** Plan meals around what's on sale

**Example:** $50/week for one person is very doable with meal planning. See Section 14 for sample budget plan.

---

### Q: Should I buy organic for meal prep?

**A:** Personal choice based on budget:
- **If budget allows:** Prioritize "Dirty Dozen" for organic (strawberries, spinach, apples, grapes, etc.)
- **If tight budget:** Conventional is fine. Washing thoroughly reduces pesticides significantly
- **Clean 15:** Produce with thick skins (avocados, pineapples, onions) have minimal pesticide residue even conventional

**Reality:** Eating conventional vegetables is infinitely healthier than not eating vegetables at all because of budget concerns.

**Balance:** Buy organic for items you eat daily or in large quantities, conventional for occasional items.

---

## Nutrition Questions

### Q: Is meal prep healthy?

**A:** It CAN be—depends what you prep:
- **Healthy prep:** Lean proteins, whole grains, lots of vegetables, controlled portions
- **Unhealthy prep:** Deep-fried foods, heavy cream sauces, excessive portions

**Meal prep itself is neutral.** It's a method. What you prep determines if it's healthy.

**Advantage:** Meal planning makes healthy eating EASIER because decisions are made in advance when you're not hungry and thinking clearly.

---

### Q: How do I meal prep for weight loss?

**A:** Key strategies:
- **Portion control:** Pre-portioned meals prevent overeating
- **Calorie tracking:** Calculate calories per meal, ensure deficit
- **High protein:** 25-35g protein per meal keeps you full
- **Volume foods:** Include lots of vegetables (low calorie, high volume)
- **Prep snacks:** 100-200 calorie snacks prevent vending machine temptation
- **Meal structure:** Plan all meals and snacks to hit calorie target

**Reality:** Meal prep is one of the most effective weight loss tools because it eliminates impulsive eating decisions.

**See:** Section 13 for detailed nutrition guidance, Section 14 for sample high-protein plan.

---

### Q: Can I meal prep for muscle gain?

**A:** Absolutely! Focus on:
- **High protein:** 0.7-1g per lb bodyweight (140-200g for 200lb person)
- **Calorie surplus:** 200-500 calories above maintenance
- **Frequent eating:** 4-6 meals spread throughout day
- **Pre/post workout nutrition:** Plan meals around training
- **Meal timing:** Protein at each meal (30-40g)

**Meal prep advantage:** Hitting high protein targets consistently is nearly impossible without planning ahead.

**See:** Section 14 for sample high-protein fitness plan with 140-150g protein daily.

---

### Q: How do I get enough vegetables in meal prep?

**A:** Strategies:
- **Half-plate rule:** Make vegetables half of every meal
- **Roast in bulk:** Sheet pan of roasted vegetables = 4-5 servings
- **Sneak into dishes:** Add spinach to smoothies, zucchini to pasta sauce
- **Prep cut vegetables:** Ready-to-eat vegetables get eaten
- **Variety:** Different vegetables every day prevents boredom
- **Multiple forms:** Raw (carrots, bell peppers), cooked (roasted broccoli), frozen (mixed vegetables in stir-fry)

**Easy wins:** Keep cherry tomatoes, baby carrots, and snap peas washed and ready to grab. No prep needed.

---

## Advanced Questions

### Q: Can I meal plan for special diets (keto, vegan, etc.)?

**A:** Yes! Meal planning works for any eating pattern:
- **Keto:** Focus on proteins, fats, low-carb vegetables
- **Vegan:** Plant proteins (tofu, tempeh, beans, lentils), whole grains
- **Paleo:** Meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds
- **Gluten-free:** Naturally GF whole foods (rice, potatoes, corn, quinoa)
- **Whole30:** Whole foods, no processed ingredients

**Advantage:** Meal planning is often EASIER with special diets because options are more limited—less decision paralysis.

**See:** Section 7 for specific diet meal planning strategies.

---

### Q: How do I meal plan for multiple dietary needs in one household?

**A:** Component cooking is the solution:
- **Cook components separately:** Plain grilled chicken + various side options
- **Deconstructed meals:** Taco bar, pasta bar, bowl meals where everyone customizes
- **Parallel cooking:** Use two pans—regular pasta + gluten-free pasta
- **Base + variations:** Make base recipe, modify portions (remove dairy for one person)

**Example:** Taco night—one person has regular tortillas, one has lettuce wraps (low-carb), one has corn tortillas (gluten-free). Same fillings, different vessels.

**See:** Section 12 for detailed multi-diet strategies.

---

### Q: What's "once a month cooking" (OAMC)?

**A:** Making 30+ meals in one long session (6-10 hours), freezing everything, thawing throughout month.

**Process:**
1. Plan 8-10 recipes that freeze well
2. Triple or quadruple each recipe
3. Dedicate full day to cooking marathon
4. Freeze in individual/family portions
5. Thaw and reheat throughout month

**Pros:** Only cook once monthly, always have meals ready
**Cons:** Requires significant time/energy, kitchen space, freezer space

**Best for:** People who hate cooking regularly, very busy schedules, batch cooking enthusiasts

**See:** Section 12 for complete OAMC guide.

---

### Q: What are the best meal planning apps?

**A:** Popular options:
- **Mealime:** Free, generates meal plans and shopping lists
- **Plan to Eat:** $6/month, drag-and-drop planning, recipe clipper
- **Paprika:** One-time $5, recipe manager + meal planner
- **Prepear:** Free, meal planning + grocery delivery integration
- **AnyList:** Free basic, recipe organization + shared lists
- **Notion/Google Sheets:** Free, completely customizable

**Reality:** Most people don't need an app. Pen and paper or simple spreadsheet works great.

**Try free first:** Start with free options or paper method. Upgrade to paid app only if you'll actually use features.

---

### Q: Should I follow meal prep influencers' plans?

**A:** Use them for inspiration, not exact replication:
- **Inspiration:** Great for meal ideas, techniques, visual presentation
- **Don't copy exactly:** Their portions/preferences/budgets differ from yours
- **Adapt to your life:** Take concepts, modify for your family's needs
- **Be realistic:** Influencers may have more time/skills/budget than you

**Warning:** Many influencer meal preps look gorgeous but aren't practical for everyday life. Focus on sustainable, realistic planning for YOUR life.

---

## Mindset Questions

### Q: I feel like I'm failing at meal planning. Is it just not for me?

**A:** Failing is part of the process. Common struggles:
- **Week 1-2:** Overwhelming, takes forever, stressful
- **Week 3-4:** Getting easier but still forgetting to eat prepped food
- **Week 5-8:** Finding rhythm, occasional slip-ups
- **Week 9+:** Feels natural, automatic

**Give it 8 weeks** before deciding it doesn't work. First attempts are always rough.

**Adjust approach:** If traditional Sunday meal prep isn't working, try different method (daily prep, split sessions, minimal prep).

**It's okay to quit:** If after 8 weeks it's causing more stress than it's solving, it might not be for you right now. Try again later.

---

### Q: Do I have to meal plan every single week?

**A:** Absolutely not! Flexibility is key:
- **Most weeks:** Full meal planning
- **Busy weeks:** Minimal prep or frozen backup meals
- **Vacation weeks:** Don't meal plan at all
- **Emergency weeks:** Takeout, convenience foods, whatever works

**Goal:** Make your life easier, not add rigid rules.

**80/20 approach:** If you meal plan 80% of weeks, you'll still get massive benefits. Perfect adherence isn't required.

---

### Q: What if I don't stick to the meal plan?

**A:** This is NORMAL. Reasons plans change:
- Unexpected events (work dinner, kid's game, friend's invitation)
- Not in mood for planned meal
- Ingredients went bad
- Just want something different

**Solutions:**
- **Flex days:** Build in 1-2 flex days for changes
- **Swap days:** Tuesday's meal moves to Thursday, no big deal
- **Freeze it:** Save planned meal for next week
- **Roll with it:** Order pizza, eat the planned meal tomorrow

**Mindset:** Meal plan is a guide, not a contract. Flexibility is essential for sustainability.

---

### Q: Is meal planning worth the effort?

**A:** For most people, yes. Benefits:
- **Time savings:** 6-11 hours/week
- **Money savings:** $200-400/month
- **Health improvement:** More home-cooked meals, less takeout
- **Stress reduction:** No more "what's for dinner?" panic
- **Food waste reduction:** 50-75% less thrown-away food

**Investment:** 2-4 hours/week
**Return:** Saves time, money, stress, and improves nutrition

**Try it:** 4-week trial. Track time and money. Most people are convinced after seeing real data.
