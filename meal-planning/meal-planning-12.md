### Freezer Organization System

#### Labeling is CRITICAL

**Label Every Item:**
- Meal name
- Date frozen
- Cooking/reheating instructions
- Number of servings

**Example Label:**
```
BEEF STEW
Frozen: 10/26/25
Servings: 6
Instructions: Stovetop 20 min or microwave 8-10 min
Eat by: 1/26/26 (3 months)
```

#### Organization Methods

**Method 1: Meal Type Zones**
- Bin 1: Breakfast items
- Bin 2: Lunches
- Bin 3: Dinners
- Bin 4: Sides and extras

**Method 2: Timeline**
- Front: Eat this month
- Middle: Next month
- Back: Long-term storage

**Method 3: Family Member**
- Dad's lunches
- Kid's breakfasts
- Family dinners
- Quick snacks

**Use Bins/Baskets:**
- Plastic bins or wire baskets
- Keep similar items together
- Easy to pull out and see contents
- Prevents avalanche

#### Freezer Inventory System

**Track What You Have:**

**Option 1: Whiteboard on Freezer**
- List all meals
- Cross off as you use
- Update when you add

**Option 2: Spreadsheet**
- Digital tracking
- Sort by date, meal type
- Check before shopping

**Option 3: App**
- FreezerBuddy, Freezer Inventory
- Scan/photo items
- Automatic tracking

**Prevents:**
- Forgetting what you have
- Food going to waste
- Duplicate meals

### Freezer Storage Times

**How Long Foods Last:**

**Cooked Meals:**
- Soups and stews: 3-4 months
- Casseroles: 2-3 months
- Cooked meats: 2-3 months
- Pizza: 1-2 months

**Raw Proteins:**
- Raw chicken: 9-12 months
- Raw beef: 6-12 months
- Raw fish: 3-6 months
- Ground meat: 3-4 months

**Breakfast Items:**
- Burritos: 1-2 months
- Pancakes/waffles: 1-2 months
- Muffins: 2-3 months

**Tip:** Still safe after these times, but quality decreases

### Thawing Strategies

**Safe Thawing Methods:**

**1. Refrigerator Thawing (Best):**
- Move from freezer to fridge night before
- Slow, safe thawing
- Takes 12-24 hours
- Best texture/quality

**2. Cold Water Thawing:**
- Sealed container in cold water
- Change water every 30 min
- 1-3 hours
- Safe and faster

**3. Microwave Thawing:**
- Use defrost setting
- Cook immediately after
- OK but not ideal texture

**4. Direct Cooking (Some Items):**
- Soups/stews: Dump frozen in pot
- Casseroles: Bake from frozen (add 50% more time)
- Breakfast burritos: Microwave from frozen

**NEVER:**
- Thaw on counter (unsafe!)
- Hot water thawing (unsafe!)

```

**Example (2000 calories, 40/30/30):**
- Protein: 800 cal = 200g (40%)
- Carbs: 600 cal = 150g (30%)
- Fat: 600 cal = 67g (30%)

#### Meal Planning with Macro Targets

**Create Meals Hitting Targets:**

## Meal Planning for Multiple Diets

### Household with Different Needs

**Common Scenarios:**

### Component Cooking Solution

**Base + Variations:**

**Example: Taco Night**

- **Keto person:** Just protein and vegetables, skip rice/beans, extra cheese
- **Vegetarian:** Skip meat, double beans, add extra toppings
- **Kid:** Simple tacos with minimal spice
- **Standard:** Full tacos with everything

**Everyone eats together, different components!**

### Adapt One Recipe

**Make One Base, Modify:**

**Example: Pasta Night**
- Cook regular pasta for family
- Cook zucchini noodles for low-carb person
- Same sauce works for both
- Separate proteins if needed (meat vs. plant-based)

**Minimal Extra Work:**
- One sauce recipe
- Multiple carb bases
- Everyone happy
