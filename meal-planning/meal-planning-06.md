## Proper Storage Techniques

### Refrigerator Storage

#### Temperature
- **Ideal:** 35-38°F (1.6-3.3°C)
- **Check regularly:** Use fridge thermometer
- **Don't overfill:** Air needs to circulate

#### Organization Strategy

**Top Shelf:**
- Ready-to-eat foods
- Leftovers (most visible, less likely to forget)
- Drinks
- Prepared meal prep containers

**Middle Shelves:**
- Dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese)
- Eggs
- Cooked proteins

**Bottom Shelf:**
- Raw meat, poultry, fish (in sealed containers)
- Keeps any drips from contaminating other food
- Coldest part of fridge

**Drawers:**
- **Crisper drawer 1:** Vegetables (high humidity setting)
- **Crisper drawer 2:** Fruits (low humidity setting)
- Keeps produce fresh longer

**Door Shelves:**
- Condiments
- Salad dressings
- Juice
- **NOT eggs or milk** (door is warmest part)

#### Meal Prep Specific Organization

**Create a "Meal Prep Zone":**
- Dedicate one shelf or section to meal prep containers
- Organize by day or meal type
- Oldest items in front (first in, first out)

**Label System:**
- Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday labels
- Or: Lunch 1, Lunch 2, Lunch 3
- Easy to grab what you need

**Keep Like Items Together:**
- All breakfast containers together
- All lunch containers together
- All snacks together

#### What NOT to Refrigerate
- Bread (gets stale faster—freeze instead)
- Tomatoes (lose flavor)
- Onions (except cut onions)
- Garlic
- Potatoes (except sweet potatoes)
- Bananas (unless very ripe and you want to slow ripening)

### Freezer Storage

#### Temperature
- **Ideal:** 0°F (-18°C) or below
- **Deep freezer:** -10°F (-23°C) to -20°F (-29°C)

#### Freezing Guidelines

**What Freezes Well:**
- ✅ Soups and stews
- ✅ Chili
- ✅ Casseroles
- ✅ Cooked grains (rice, quinoa)
- ✅ Cooked proteins (chicken, beef, pork)
- ✅ Bread and baked goods
- ✅ Cooked beans
- ✅ Tomato-based sauces
- ✅ Cooked pasta (slightly undercook)
- ✅ Meatballs and burgers
- ✅ Cookie dough
- ✅ Fruits and vegetables (blanched)

**What Doesn't Freeze Well:**
- ❌ Cream-based sauces (can separate)
- ❌ Mayo-based dishes
- ❌ Fried foods (get soggy)
- ❌ Raw vegetables with high water content (lettuce, cucumber)
- ❌ Cooked eggs (rubbery texture)
- ❌ Soft cheeses
- ❌ Dishes with crispy toppings

**Tips Can Make Freezing Better:**
- Cream sauces: Add cream after reheating
- Fried foods: Reheat in oven/air fryer to restore crispness
- Pasta: Undercook slightly

#### Proper Freezing Technique

**Step 1: Cool Completely**
- Never freeze hot food
- Cool to room temperature first
- Spread on baking sheet to cool faster

**Step 2: Portion Appropriately**
- Single servings or family-sized portions
- Consider how you'll use it
- Easier to thaw what you need

**Step 3: Remove Air**
- Prevents freezer burn
- Use vacuum sealer if possible
- Or press air out of freezer bags
- Leave 1/2 inch headspace in containers (liquid expands)

**Step 4: Wrap Properly**
- Double wrap for longer storage
- Aluminum foil over containers
- Freezer bags over wrapped items
- Protects from freezer burn

**Step 5: Label Clearly**
- Name of dish
- Date frozen
- Number of servings
- Reheating instructions (optional)
- Use permanent marker or freezer tape

**Step 6: Freeze Flat**
- Lay bags flat on baking sheet
- Once frozen, stack vertically (like files)
- Saves massive amounts of space

**Step 7: Use Within Timeframe**
- Most foods: 2-3 months for best quality
- Can be safe longer but quality decreases
- Rotate stock (first in, first out)

#### Freezer Organization

**By Category:**
- One section for proteins
- One for complete meals
- One for soups
- One for sides
- One for baked goods/bread

**By Date:**
- Oldest items at front or on top
- New items to back or bottom
- Use oldest first

**Vertical Storage:**

- In sealed containers or on a plate
- Separate from ready-to-eat foods

**2. Use Separate Cutting Boards**
- One for raw meat
- One for produce
- Different colors help remember

**3. Wash Hands**
- Before and after handling food
- Especially after touching raw meat
- 20 seconds with soap

**4. Don't Reuse Marinades**
- That touched raw meat
- Or boil it first before using as sauce

**5. Keep Hot Foods Hot, Cold Foods Cold**
- Hot foods: Above 140°F (60°C)
- Cold foods: Below 40°F (4°C)
- "Danger zone" is 40-140°F (bacteria growth)

## Packaging Methods

### Vacuum Sealing

**What It Is:**
- Removes all air from packaging
- Seals food in plastic bag
- Requires vacuum sealer machine

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Extends freezer life significantly (2-3x longer)
- ✅ Prevents freezer burn
- ✅ Saves space (no air in bags)
- ✅ Keeps food fresher
- ✅ Perfect for sous vide cooking

**Best For:**
- Long-term freezer storage
- Bulk meat purchases
- Fish
- Cheese
- Marinating (vacuum pulls marinade into meat)

**Cost:**
- Vacuum sealer: $30-200
- Bags: $10-30 per roll
- Worth it if you meal prep regularly and use freezer often

**Popular Brands:**
- FoodSaver
- Nesco
- Anova (for sous vide)

### Freezer Bags (Manual Method)

**Water Displacement Method:**
- Removes air without vacuum sealer
- Free method!

**How To:**
1. Place food in freezer bag
2. Seal bag most of the way, leaving 1 inch open
3. Slowly lower bag into pot of water
4. Water pressure pushes air out
5. Seal completely just before bag goes underwater
6. Remove and dry

**Works Great!** Nearly as good as vacuum sealing.

### Wrapping for Freezing

**Double-Wrap Method:**

**Best for:** Large items (casseroles, lasagnas, bread)

**Process:**
1. **First layer:** Plastic wrap directly on food
2. **Second layer:** Aluminum foil over plastic wrap
3. **Optional third layer:** Freezer bag
4. **Label** on foil or bag

**Why?**
- Plastic wrap clings to food (prevents air pockets)
- Aluminum foil protects from freezer burn
- Double protection = longer freezer life

### Preventing Sogginess

**Common Problem:**
Crispy or fresh items get soggy in meal prep containers.

**Solutions:**

**1. Store Components Separately**
- Keep wet and dry ingredients apart
- Assemble right before eating
- Examples: Salad dressing, crispy toppings, sauces

**2. Use Paper Towels**
- Place paper towel in container with vegetables
- Absorbs excess moisture
- Change paper towel if it gets saturated

**3. Vent Containers**
- Don't seal completely until food is cold
- Allows steam to escape
- Prevents condensation

**4. Choose the Right Container**
- Containers with vent holes
- Or leave lid slightly ajar until cool

**5. Pat Dry**
- Dry washed vegetables thoroughly
- Pat cooked proteins dry before storing
- Less moisture = less sogginess

**6. Add Crispy Elements Fresh**
- Croutons
- Tortilla chips
- Fried onions
- Nuts (sometimes)
- Granola

### Mason Jar Layering (For Salads)

**Prevents Soggy Salads!**

**Layering Order (Bottom to Top):**
1. **Dressing** (bottom)
2. **Hard vegetables** (carrots, peppers, cucumbers)
3. **Protein** (chicken, beans, chickpeas)
4. **Grains** (quinoa, pasta)
5. **Soft vegetables** (tomatoes, avocado)
6. **Cheese** (if using)
7. **Greens** (top—stays crispy!)

**How to Eat:**
- Shake jar to distribute dressing
- Or pour into bowl

**Storage:** 3-5 days (greens stay fresh!)

### Portion Control Packaging

**Individual Portions:**
- 1 meal per container
- Grab and go
- Built-in portion control
- Perfect for singles or packed lunches

**Family-Style Portions:**
- 4-6 servings per container
- Reheat and serve family dinner
- Saves containers
- Less portioning work

**Hybrid:**
- Some individual (lunches)
- Some family (dinners)
- Flexible based on needs
