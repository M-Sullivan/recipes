## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 bag (16 oz) frozen mixed vegetables
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 tbsp butter
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1 cup beef broth

## Instructions

6. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Transfer beef mixture to a greased 9x13 baking dish.

8. Spread mashed potatoes evenly over beef mixture.
